# TODO

- consider writing a k8s API middleware
- clean up actions
  - async ones need request/receive/failure types
  - FSA seems reasonable
- check out redux-react-router
- look into properly vendoring Semantic UI
- left-side dark sidebar might be better than current "floating" "sidebar"
- every k8s object should be viewable as a "Page"
- highlight the parent-child/ownership relation between an RC and its pods
